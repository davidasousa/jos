Exercise 4)
1) What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation could not be provided?)

Answer: The purpose of having individual handler functions for each exception is to ensure that the proper priveledge levels are set and the proper function pointer to the interrupt is passed in when the trap is set before execution. Additionally we need to ensure that error messages will be printed if needed which only some of the included traps require.

2) Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave correctly? The grade script expects it to produce a general protection fault (trap 13), but softint’s code says int $14. Why should this produce interrupt vector 13? What happens if the kernel actually allows softint’s int $14 instruction to invoke the kernel’s page fault handler (which is interrupt vector 14)?

Answer: No additional work was required to allow the softint to work properly. Page fault can only be executed by the kernel and because this is a user level process the interrupt is transitioned to be a general protection interrupt. This prevents user page faults from creating memory issues with kernel level memory.
